In chapter three of "To Kill a Mockingbird," Scout starts school for the first time, and we see how education is approached in Maycomb, Alabama. The first thing that stands out is Miss Caroline Fisher, the teacher from North Alabama who is unfamiliar with the local ways of doing things. One of the first incidents occurs when Miss Caroline offers Walter Cunningham Jr. a quarter for lunch when he says he doesn't have any. This causes a stir among the other students, who know that the Cunninghams don't take charity. Scout tries to explain this to Miss Caroline, saying, "He's a Cunningham," but the teacher doesn't understand and becomes frustrated with Scout. Later in the chapter, Scout gets in trouble for knowing how to read and write before starting school. Miss Caroline tells her, "Now you tell your father not to teach you any more. It's best to begin reading with a fresh mind." Scout finds this confusing and unfair, especially since Atticus taught her to read and write. She says, "Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing." This incident sets up one of the major themes of the book, which is the tension between tradition and progress, and how that tension plays out in a small Southern town like Maycomb. Atticus, who values education and is proud of his children's knowledge, tells Scout, "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view." He also teaches Scout the importance of empathy, saying, "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...until you climb into his skin and walk around in it." We also see more of Scout's family dynamics in this chapter. We get a sense of how proud and protective Atticus is of his children, and how he tries to instill in them a sense of empathy and understanding for others. We also see how much Scout looks up to her older brother, Jem, and how he tries to guide her through the complexities of life in Maycomb. Chapter three sets up many of the major themes and conflicts that will play out in the rest of the book. It shows us how education and tradition can be at odds with each other, and how the different social classes in Maycomb interact with each other. It also gives us more insight into Scout's family and their values, setting the stage for some of the major events that will happen later on in the story.
