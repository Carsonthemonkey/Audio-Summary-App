Today, we're going to talk about for loops in Java. For loops are used to iterate over a block of code a fixed number of times. Let's take a look at the syntax for a for loop in Java: so we are gonna write for, and then the first variable will be our initialization variable, then a semicolon, then the condition for when our loop will run, and then the update statement, which is what we want to happen each time the loop runs. The initialization part is executed only once, at the beginning of the loop. It is usually used to initialize the loop variable. The condition part is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. If it is true, the loop continues to run. If it is false, the loop stops. The update part is executed at the end of each iteration of the loop. It is usually used to update the loop variable. So, how would you use a for loop in practice? Let's say you want to print the numbers from 1 to 10. You could use a for loop like this: so we write for and then int i = 0, then our condition, so i <= 10, and then finally we want to increment i each time, so we write i++. Then inside of the body of the loop here, we are gonna say system dot out dot print line i. In this example, the initialization part sets the loop variable i to 1. The condition part checks if i is less than or equal to 10. If it is, the loop continues. The update part increments i by 1 at the end of each iteration. Inside the loop, we simply print out the value of i. You can use a for loop to iterate over any collection of items, such as an array or a list. The syntax is similar to the example we just saw. You would simply replace the condition part with a condition that checks if you've reached the end of the collection. Inside the loop, you can access each element of the collection by its index.
