So when we want to get the distance between two points in code, the way we do this is by imagining a triangle between the two, where the hypotenuse of the triangle is the line between each point. So using this, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance between the two points. So if you don't remember, the Pythagorean theorem is a squared plus b squared equals c squared, where c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the two other sides. So how do we do this with code? Well, if we have our x component and our y component, each point, the formula is pretty simple. We're just going to take the square root of x1 minus x2 squared, plus y1 minus y2 squared, and that will give us c, which is the length of the hypotenuse, and that's the distance between the two points. So yeah, it's actually a pretty simple calculus, and yeah, it's great.
