# Summary

In this lecture, we learned about derivatives and their importance in calculus. Derivatives measure how fast a function changes at a specific point and give us the slope of the curve at that point. We also discussed some methods for finding derivatives, such as the power rule and chain rule.

The power rule tells us that if we have a function of the form $f(x) = x^n$, then its derivative is $n\times x^{n-1}$. The chain rule helps us find the derivative of composite functions by using the formula: 

$$\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = \frac{df}{dg}\times\frac{dg}{dx}$$

We applied these rules to an example where we had to find the derivative of $f(x)=(x^2+1)^3$ using the chain rule. The final answer was $\frac{df}{dx}=3(x^2+1)^2\times 2x$.

Overall, derivatives are essential in solving real-world problems involving rates of change or maximum/minimum values of functions.
