This lecture discusses for loops in Java, which are used to iterate over a block of code a fixed number of times. The syntax for a for loop consists of the initialization variable, followed by the condition when the loop will run and an update statement that executes each time the loop runs. The initialization part is executed only once at the beginning of the loop while  the condition part is evaluated at every iteration to check if it's true or false; If it's true, then  the body continues running but stops when it evaluates as false. Finally, during each iteration cycle ,update statements are executed.

To demonstrate how we can use For Loops in practice: printing numbers from one through ten using java programming language involves writing `for (int i = 0; i <=10 ; i++) { System.out.println(i); }`. In this example,the initialization sets our variable 'i' equal to one.The Condition checks whether 'i' value is less than or equals ten.If yes,it proceeds with executing its content.Incrementing happens after executing all instructions inside curly brackets.This prints out values from one through ten.

For loops can also be utilized on any collection such as arrays or lists where you replace your condition with another checking if you've reached end-of-collection point.You can access individual elements within these collections using their index inside curly brackets.
 
Overall,a clear understanding has been provided regarding what For Loops are and how they operate syntactically.Its practical implementation was demonstrated via an example involving printing numbers from one through ten.A key takeaway would be its usability on different kinds of collections such as arrays and lists among others,and accessing specific items within those collections based on indices.
