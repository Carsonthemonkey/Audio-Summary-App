# Chapter Three Overview of "To Kill a Mockingbird"

In chapter three of "To Kill a Mockingbird," Scout starts her first day at school in Maycomb, Alabama. The teacher, Miss Caroline Fisher, is from North Alabama and unfamiliar with the local ways. When she offers Walter Cunningham Jr. a quarter for lunch after he says he has none, it causes a stir among the other students who know that the Cunninghams don't take charity.

> "Miss Caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more, it would interfere with my reading." - Scout

Scout tries to explain this to Miss Caroline but gets rebuffed instead. Later on in the chapter, Scout gets into trouble for knowing how to read and write before starting school when Miss Caroline tells her not to let Atticus teach her anymore because it's best to begin reading with a fresh mind.

> "Atticus ain't ever whipped me since I can remember. I wanta keep it that way." - Jem

This incident sets up one of the major themes of tradition versus progress throughout small Southern towns like Maycomb. Atticus values education and teaches his children empathy by telling them they never really understand someone until they consider things from their point of view or walk around in their skin.

Chapter three also gives insight into Scout's family dynamics as we see how proud and protective Atticus is over his children while Jem guides Scout through life complexities within Maycomb society.

Overall Chapter Three sets up many major themes such as conflicts between education/tradition & different social classes interacting with each other while giving us more insight into characters' backgrounds which will be important later on within To Kill A Mockingbird story line
