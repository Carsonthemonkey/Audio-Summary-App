# Notes

## Introduction
- The speaker is questioning why people question the decision to go to the moon.
- He compares it to other challenging goals, like climbing a mountain or flying across the Atlantic.
- Going to the moon will be difficult but worth doing because it will bring out humanity's best skills and energies.

## Importance of Space Exploration Efforts
- Shifting efforts from low gear space exploration to high gear is an important decision made during his presidency.
- New facilities are being created for complex explorations in history. 
  - A Saturn C1 booster rocket has been tested multiple times generating power equivalent to 10,000 automobiles with their accelerator on full speed.
  - Five F1 rocket engines each as powerful as all eight engines of Saturn combined would be clustered together at Cape Canaveral.
    - It would create an advanced missile that's assembled in a new building taller than a 48-story structure, wider than a city block and longer than two lengths of this field.  
- In just nineteen months forty-five satellites have circled around Earth; most were made by America providing more knowledge about space science compared Soviet Union’s satellites. 
   Mariner spacecraft sent towards Venus was very sophisticated instrument ever built for space science purposes having accuracy comparable similar firing missiles from Cape Canaveral dropping them between stadium’s forty-yard lines.

## Benefits of Space Exploration Efforts:
### Science & Education: 
New discoveries related universe and environment enrich growths our education system through new techniques learning mapping observation tools computers industry medicine home school etc., which technical institutions such as Rice University can benefit greatly.

### Economic Growth:
Space exploration creates many job opportunities along with establishing numerous companies requiring skilled personnel investment demands especially Houston City where manned spacecraft center located becoming heart large scientific engineering community sharing regionally economic growth benefits.


## Conclusion
Houston City once furthest outpost old frontier West now becomes furthest outpost new frontier science-space bringing significant growth and progress to region.
