# G.I.S.T
## (GPT Interpreted Speech to Text)
App to summarize audio files for the LC ACM spring 2023 hackathon

*Created by Kat Berge & Carson Reader*


This is a website that can transcribe audio like lectures and then summarize it using ChatGPT's API. It is still a work in progress, but it has functionality right now. It requires an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to work. The site does not collect or store your API key in any way. The site can be found [here](https://carsonthemonkey.github.io/GIST/)


Dev rules:
- React component files should start with a capital letter
- React components go into components folder, any regular js or ts files go into utils
- Always write stylesheets in Sass and transpile to CSS in order to stay more organized
- Write Sass stylesheets per component
