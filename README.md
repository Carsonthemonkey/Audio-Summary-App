App to summarize audio files for the LC ACM spring 2023 hackathon

Dev rules:
- React component files should start with a capital letter
- React components go into components folder, any regular js or ts files go into utils
- Always write stylesheets in Sass and transpile to CSS in order to stay more organized
- Write Sass stylesheets per component
